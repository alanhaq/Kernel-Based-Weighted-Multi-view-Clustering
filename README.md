# Kernel-Based-Weighted-Multi-view-Clustering
####  In this project we discuss the paper Kernel-Based Weighted Multi-view Clustering by Grigorios Tzortzis and Aristidis Likas[3]. We will go into the details of the paper, it's formulation and results, as well as our own implementation of their algorithms. Most of the code used to create our own implementation comes from the author's publicly available code, where we have changed a few things, mostly data pre-processing.
